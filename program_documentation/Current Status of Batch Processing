Current Status Summary
We've successfully implemented the core of batch processing for the Smarty API in your codebase, focusing on smarty_validation.py. The changes include:

Added helper functions: chunk_candidates and prepare_batch_payload to split candidates into batches and build JSON payloads while respecting Smarty's limits (100 addresses or 32KB).
Added the main batch function: validate_with_smarty_batch, which sends POST requests for batches, handles retries, errors, and timeouts (reusing your single-address logic).
Refactored process_smarty_corrections to use batches instead of single-address calls, updating the DataFrame, corrections, flags, and errors accordingly. Added batches_sent to results for tracking.
Config updates in settings.py: Confirmed/added batch constants like SMARTY_BATCH_SIZE, SMARTY_MIN_BATCH_SIZE, SMARTY_BATCH_TIMEOUT, and SMARTY_BATCH_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES.
Testing: Provided a sample test_subscribers.csv with 10 rows (mix of valid/invalid addresses). Your runs show the script executes, batches are created/sent, but parsing fails with "Unexpected batch error: 0" due to Smarty's flat JSON response structure.
The batch sending works (200 status, valid response body in logs), but parsing needs one more fix to group results by "input_index". No changes yet to log_smarty_usage or reporting.py (Step 5 pending).

What Needs to Be Done to Finish Implementing Batch Processing
Apply the Parsing Fix (Step 3.1): Update the response parsing in validate_with_smarty_batch as per my last message (group matches using "input_index" into per-address lists). This is the final code tweak for core functionality.
Step 5: Update Logging and Reporting:
In smarty_validation.py: Modify log_smarty_usage to include batches_sent (e.g., add param and log it in CSV).
In reporting.py: Update smarty_summary in generate_validation_report to include batches_sent in the "Summary" tab of _VR.xlsx and JSON report.
This adds ~10-20 lines total, enhancing visibility (e.g., "Batches Sent: 1").
Full Integration Test: Re-run with test_subscribers.csv after fixes. Verify outputs (e.g., corrected addresses in Excel, successes in Smarty Log, no errors).
Optional Polish: Add fallback to single-address if batch fails entirely (e.g., in validate_with_smarty_batch, if all retries fail, loop with validate_with_smarty).
Done: Once tested, batch processing is complete—sequential, efficient, and integrated.
Estimated time: 30-60 mins for fixes/tests.

Quick Review of Debugging the Batch Upload Process
Issue: Batch POST succeeds (200 status), but response parsing fails ("Unexpected error: 0") because Smarty returns a flat list of matches, not grouped per address.
Progress: Raw response logs (added in Step 4.1) confirmed valid JSON with "input_index". The proposed fix (group by "input_index") should resolve it.
Next Actions:
Implement the updated parsing code from my last message.
Re-run test and check logs for "Batch processed: 4 results, X successes" (X should be 3-4).
If fixed, Smarty Log should show corrected addresses (e.g., "123 MAIN" → "123 Main St", Status="Valid").
If not, share new raw response/logs for further tweaks (e.g., if response format varies).
Tips: Ensure DEBUG_MODE=True for full logs. If 429 (rate limit), add longer delays. Credentials are correct (secret key confirmed via screenshot).
